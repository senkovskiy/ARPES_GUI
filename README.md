# ANTARES data browser for micro-ARPES spatial maps

This is an interactive software allowing to visualize and treat the micro-ARPES spatial maps from ANTARES beamline at syncrotron radiation facility Soleil.
The micro-ARPES data are stored in Nexus files with HDF5.

Main features:
- visualize the ARPES image from the selected point in spatial map,
- select the region of interest in real (E vs. angle) and momentum (E vs. k) space and integrate the spatial map inside this region,
- save images (cvg, jpg etc.) and data (ARPES or spatial) in 'csv' format.
